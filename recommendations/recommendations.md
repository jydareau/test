#### Recommendations <a id="recommendations"></a>

As Security Center collects data from your Azure resources, it will periodically analyze the contents of that data and present you with recommendations to address potential security vulnerabilities. On the Security Center blade, the Recommendations tile displays the total number of available recommendations. If you click on the recommendation tile it will present you with the full list of recommendations. ![Screenshot of the recommendations dashboard. 9 recommendations are shown. ](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/c31dd3047de5832d4ec8306c5b5147cb/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZURE208x+3T2018+type@asset+block/M3L3T1_hxpCXw4.png)

Some examples of recommendations provided by Security Center include:

* Provisioning anti-malware to help identify and remove malicious software.
* Configuring network security groups and rules to control traffic to virtual machines.
* Provisioning of web application firewalls to help defend against attacks that target your web applications.
