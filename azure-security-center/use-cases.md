# Use Cases

Most organizations have solutions on-premises for monitoring the security of their infrastructure. As more resources are moved to the Azure cloud, the security of the cloud resources becomes a growing concern. Security Center will give you the tools needed to address your organization’s security posture in the cloud.

Here are a few examples where these tools can be leveraged.

* **Monitor Security State Across Subscriptions.** With Azure Security Center, you get a central view of the security state of all of your Azure resources. At a glance, verify that the appropriate security controls are in place and configured correctly. And quickly identify any resources that require attention.
* **Find and Fix Security Vulnerabilities.** Rapidly enable a range of security solutions from Microsoft and its partners, including industry-leading firewalls and antimalware. Use streamlined provisioning to easily deploy security solutions—even networking changes are configured for you. And security events from partner solutions are automatically collected for analysis and alerting.
* **Staying ahead of current and emerging cloud threats requires an integrated, analytics-driven approach.** Bycombining Microsoft global threat intelligence and expertise with insights into cloud security-related events across your Azure deployments, Azure Security Center helps you detect actual threats early, and it reduces false positives. Cloud security alerts offer insights into the attack campaign, including related events and impacted resources, and suggest ways to remediate issues and recover quickly.
