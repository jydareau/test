#### Integrate and Analyze Security Center Insights <a id="integrate-and-analyze-security-center-insights"></a>

You can **integrate** Security Center insights with the REST API or **Azure** Log Integration. You can analyze Security Center insights with **Power BI**.

**Azure Log Integration** ![Screenshot of the Log Integration link on the Security Center dashboard.](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/f66f55e3210b380ac1d3cf4438fc780e/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZURE208x+3T2018+type@asset+block/M3L1T7_FVg7NrU.png)

Many security operations and incident response teams rely on a Security Information and Event Management \(SIEM\) solution as the starting point for triaging and investigating security alerts. With [Microsoft Azure Log Integration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-azure-log-integration-get-started), customers can sync Security Center alerts and virtual machine security events, collected by Azure Diagnostics and Azure Audit Logs, with their log analytics or SIEM solution in near real time. Azure log integration works with HP ArcSight, Splunk, IBM QRadar, and others.

**Power BI** ![Screenshot of the Power BI link off the Security Center dashboard. ](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/f3dae0d7dca031f011cc43ae218463cb/asset-v1:Microsoft+AZURE208x+3T2018+type@asset+block/M3L1T7_iab2LuM.png)

Get insights into your Azure workload security by connecting your Azure Security Data with Power BI. Power BI automatically creates a dashboard and report on top of your Azure Security Center data enabling you to analyze and explore the data. You can create a Security Insights dashboard to explore your security status, threats and detections across subscriptions. You can also create a Policy Management dashboard to explore management and enforcement of policy across subscriptions, and find subscriptions who don't meet policy.
