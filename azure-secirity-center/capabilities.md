[Azure Security Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/apps-and-data?WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=AID529565_SEM_hsE8x2xe&utm_source=Bing&utm_medium=CPC&utm_term=azure%20security%20center&utm_campaign=Trusted_Cloud) provides you with a centralized view of your Azure resources and their active security state. It provides integrated security monitoring and policy management across your Azure subscriptions, helps detect threats that might otherwise go unnoticed, and works with a broad ecosystem of security solutions. These solutions are delivered through the following capabilities:

* **Prevent**. Security Center will monitor the state of your Azure resources based on how you configure the security policies for your organization, applications, and data.
* **Detect**. Security Center will automatically collect and analyze security data from your Azure resources, the network, and partner solutions like anti-malware programs and firewalls. It leverages global threat intelligence from Microsoft products and services, the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit \(DCU\), the Microsoft Security Response Center \(MSRC\), and external feeds.
* **Respond**. Security Center provides you with prioritized security and incident alerts. It offers insights into the source of an attack and any impacted resources, along with suggestions on how to stop the current attack and help prevent future attacks.
